The Python program provided for Caesar cipher encryption and decryption has minimal requirements, but hereâ€™s a comprehensive list to ensure it runs smoothly:

1. Python Version
Python 3.x: The code is written for Python 3. It may not work correctly with Python 2 due to differences in print statements and string handling.
2. Required Libraries
Standard Libraries: The code relies solely on Python's built-in libraries, so no additional libraries are required.
3. System Requirements
Operating System: The code should work on any operating system that supports Python (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
4. User Input
Valid Message: Users should input valid text. The program handles letters and other characters (spaces, punctuation) but assumes input is a string.
Shift Value: Users need to enter a valid integer for the shift value. The program assumes integer input and handles both positive and negative shifts.
5. Error Handling
Integer Conversion: The code assumes that the user inputs a valid integer for the shift value. In a production environment, you might want to add error handling to manage invalid input gracefully.
6. Command Line Execution
The script is intended to be run in a command-line environment (terminal or command prompt) where users interact with it through text input.
Summary of the Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on the system.
Command-line environment for running the script.
Valid text input from the user.
Valid integer input for shift values.
